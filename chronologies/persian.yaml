  description: |
    The Solar Hijri calendar (Persian: گاه‌شماری هجری خورشیدی) is the official
    calendar of Iran and Afghanistan. It is a solar calendar with 12 months,
    beginning on the March equinox. The first six months have 31 days, the
    next five have 30 days, and the last month has 29 days (30 in leap years).
    The calendar uses a complex 2820-year cycle for determining leap years,
    but can be approximated by a simpler rule.
