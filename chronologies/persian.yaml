  description: |
    The Solar Hijri calendar (Persian: گاه‌شماری هجری خورشیدی) is the official
    calendar of Iran and Afghanistan. It is a solar calendar with 12 months,
    beginning on the March equinox.

    The first six months have 31 days, the next five have 30 days, and the
    last month has 29 days (30 in leap years). This arithmetic version uses
    a 2820-year cycle approximation for leap years.
