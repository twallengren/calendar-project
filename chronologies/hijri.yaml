  description: |
    The tabular Islamic calendar is an arithmetic approximation of the lunar
    Hijri calendar. It uses a 30-year cycle with 11 leap years to approximate
    the lunar month cycle. Months alternate between 30 and 29 days, with the
    12th month (Dhu al-Hijjah) having 30 days in leap years.

    This is suitable for civil and computational purposes. For religious
    observances, the actual Hijri calendar based on moon sighting may differ
    by 1-2 days.
